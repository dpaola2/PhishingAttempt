Created a mirror using this command:

- ```$ wget -mk <url>```

Had to do both the base website and explicitly mirror the `/wp/xplore` directory to obtain the PHP file

URLs found:

```<form novalidate method="post" action="http://www.kamesinvestmentint.com/wp/xplore/babajesus/mail.php" id="gaia_loginform">```

Many images are hosted on millwallcu.com:

- ```http://www.millwallcu.com/files/photo.png```
- ```http://www.millwallcu.com/files/wlogostrip_230x17_1x.png```
- ```http://www.millwallcu.com/files/universal_language_settings-21.png```

also found this weird thing in the footer:

```<!-- l25.member.sg3.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Sat Apr  5 10:06:59 PDT 2014 -->```
