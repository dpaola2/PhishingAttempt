1. Go to your Admin Panel -> Database and click "Import" button (top left corner) in appeared file upload form choose the SQL dump file which located in main patch folder: sql_update.sql, and click on GO button.

2. Unzip all files and copy each file to necessary directory on your server, remember! that you need to copy only your template files from /templates/ directory in the patch.


NOTICE: If your site was customized you should compare and merge new files with current files (located on server) before uploading new files to the server, the same operations should be done with template files.

Update completed, now you should test all site functionality and feel free to contact us if you faced with any problems.

Thanks for your attention.
